# DuoForWeb

A 'Duo For Web' prototype, inspired by <a href="https://allo.google.com/">Google Allo</a>.

## What
When you go to the website, you will randomly get connected to another user (at least, if someone is online and available).
The stranger will also see your questions and the Google response.

## What can it do?
That's actually a question you can ask the assistant by yourself.
But you can also ask for:
* 'Show me ${tag}' to get images from your tag/
* 'Play ${tag}' to play a video of the tag
* 'Search for ${tag}' if you want to search for the tag on the web.
